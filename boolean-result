a)Check whether the given strings contain 0xB0. Display a boolean result as shown below.

import re
line1 = 'start address: 0xA0, func1 address: 0xC0'
line2 = 'end address: 0xFF, func2 address: 0xB0'
print(bool(re.search(r'0xB0', line1)))
print(bool(re.search(r'0xB0', line2)))
#or
print(bool(re.findall(r'0xB0', line1)))
print(bool(re.findall(r'0xB0', line2)))
#or we can't use 'match' here
print(bool(re.search(r'(.*B)', line1)))
print(bool(re.search(r'(.*B)', line2)))

b) Replace all occurrences of 5 with five for the given string.

ip = 'They ate 5 apples and 5 oranges'
print(re.sub(r'5',"five",ip))

c)finding "ape" in given sequence

if re.search("ape","The ape was at the apex"):

    print("there is an ape")

allaps = re.findall("ape","The ape was at the apex")

for i in allaps:
    print(i)
    
d) find span of "ape" in given sequence

thestr = "The ape was at the apex"

for i in re.finditer("ape",thestr):
    locTuple = i.span()

    print(locTuple)

    print(thestr[locTuple[0]:locTuple[1]])
    
e) Finding specific animals from list.

animal = "cat fat rat mat pat"

animals = re.findall("[c-mC_M]at",animal)
animals = re.findall("[^Cr]at",animal)
for i in animals:
    print(i)

print()
